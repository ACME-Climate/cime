  =========================================
  COMPSET naming convention
  =========================================
  The compset longname below has the specified order 
  atm, lnd, ice, ocn, river, glc wave cesm-options

  The notation for the compset longname is
     TIME_ATM[%phys]_LND[%phys]_ICE[%phys]_OCN[%phys]_ROF[%phys]_GLC[%phys]_WAV[%phys][_BGC%phys]
  Where for the CAM specific compsets below the following is supported
    TIME = Time period (e.g. 2000, HIST, RCP8...)
    ATM  = [CAM4, CAM5]
    LND  = [CLM40, CLM45, CLM50, SLND]
    ICE  = [CICE, DICE, SICE]
    OCN  = [DOCN, ,AQUAP, SOCN]
    ROF  = [RTM, SROF]
    GLC  = [CISM1, CISM2, SGLC]
    WAV  = [SWAV]
    BGC  = optional BGC scenario 

  The OPTIONAL %phys attributes specify submodes of the given system
  For example DOCN%DOM is the data ocean model for DOCN
  ALL the possible %phys choices for each component are listed 
  with the -list command for create_newcase
  ALL data models must have a %phys option that corresponds to the data  model mode 

  Each compset is associated with the following
  - longname      
  - alias        
  - grid           optional requirements for grid to work with the compset
  - support_level  optional description of the support level for this compset
  NOTE: 
  The glc grid specifies the ***internal*** grid used by glimmer/cism
  from the point of view of coupling - the glc grid is assumed to be 
  identical to the land.
