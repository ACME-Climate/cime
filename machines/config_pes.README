real element value to whatever the atm is at that time

default machine / default grid => always a match
forced settings 

(1) target machine / target grid  (if match apply forced settings and stop)
(2) target grid / default machine (if match apply forced settings and stop)
(3) target machine / default grid (if match apply forced settings and stop)

set default settings for target machine if there is no grid match
4) overwrite with forced settings if match

Notes about the interpretation of attributes in this file (by
ConfigCase.pm : set_pes)
==============================================================

GRID: the value of the attribute can match either the beginning or
end of the grid specification

CCSM_LCOMPSET: the value of the attribute can match ANYWHERE in the
long compset name (similar to GEN_COMPSET_MATCH in
config_compsets.xml). Note, though, that this uses regular
expressions, so you can match B compsets using CCSM_LCOMPSET="^B". 

TEST: Matches on testname + test options (PET_PT_D) 
The test name can be either specified as a text string, or with
a regular expression.  If one wants to allow a specific test, 
input the test name as a string. 
If one wants to DISALLOW the pe layout for a specific test use 
the following regex, which will be passed along to 
ConfigCase->set_pes: TEST="^(?:(?!PATTERN).)*$", and replace
PATTERN with the desired test name. 

All other attributes: the value of the attribute must match the
beginning of the variable.

==============================================================
Matching compsets
==============================================================

Compsets should be matched using their long name (using
CCSM_LCOMPSET), NOT their short name. This allows for the use of
compsets that do not have a short name.
